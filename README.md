# NathalievanSterkenburg-pset2

This is the second project I made for the course native appstudio. It is an app in which you can play the game mad libs.
You are asked to blindly fill in some blanks in a story and at the end you will be shown the completed story, which is usually hilarious.
Below are three screenshots that each show one of the three activities in the app. First starting screen, second filling in blanks and third the completed story.
